# Adding UAST Annotations

# Intro

Once you have written the [AST parser](sdk.md) the next step is to write
the annotation code. This is the Go language code that will establish the rules to
transform the original AST into the UAST (a process we call normalizing). Most of
the files related to the Go part of the driver are auto-generated by the
[`bblfsh-sdk init` tool](sdk.md), but in order to translate the native AST
to the UAST you need to complete two skeleton files that are referenced in the
(auto-generated) `driver/main.go` file.

## File: parser.go

### ToNoder interface & implementation

ToNoder is a interface that annotators would need to fill in the
`driver/normalizer/parser.go` file, but a default
[native.ObjectToNoder](https://godoc.org/github.com/bblfsh/sdk/protocol/native#ObjectToNoder)
implementation is provided in the SDK for trees represented as nested JSON
objects. It serves to establish the role of some internal keys in the native AST
into specific key roles in the UAST. This is needed so the rule applying process
knows what parts of the native AST use to do the translation. The skeleton of this
struct will be automatically generated by the `bblfsh-sdk init` command. 

The type and meaning of the fields in the native.ObjectToNoder struct can be
checked on the [GoDoc documentation of the
type](https://godoc.org/github.com/bblfsh/sdk/protocol/native#ObjectToNoder).

### UASTParserBuilder function

This automatically generated function will return a driver.UASTParser object that
will be constructed using your provided ToNoder implementation. This is the
function referred in the `main.go` file and you usually will not need to change it.

### Examples

Check the already implemented [Java
ObjectToNoder](https://github.com/bblfsh/java-driver/blob/master/driver/normalizer/parser.go)
or [Python
one](https://github.com/bblfsh/python-driver/blob/master/driver/normalizer/parser.go)
for real world examples of the ObjectToNoder struct filled.

## File: annotation.go

### AnnotationRules 

This variable will hold a Rule object and is the result of the applying of the
different rules using the functions defined in the file ``sdk/uast/ann/ann.go``
file. This is done by calling the `On` rule constructor and chaining calls to the
different selectors, rule constructors (a rule can hold other rules itself) and
predicates to build your AST to UAST normalizer.

To see how rules are built it's important to understand that a rule is composed
of:

- One or more *predicates* that will select what nodes will match the rule.
- One of more *actions* that will apply to the matching nodes.
- Zero or more *selectors* that will optionally select more nodes starting
  from the current ones and apply the rule/s in its argument list.
- Zero or more additional *rules* contained inside to the *selectors*.

The rule constructor is the function `On(predicates...) *Rule`. As you can see
in the signature, it takes one of more predicates and returns a rule pointer. This 
allows for chaining of different methods taking a rule pointer. A general form
for a rule definition could this be like:

```go
// Simple example:
var r  := On(somePredicate).SomeAction(actionParams)

// A more elaborate example:
var r2 := On(otherPredicate).SomeSelector(
    On(thirdPredicate).SomeAction(actionParams), // embedded rule
    On(fouthPredicate).SomeSelector( // embedded rule with its own childs
        On(fithPredicate).SomeAction(actionParams),
    )).SomeAction(actionPArams)
```

#### Predicates

Predicates are any function that follow the signature: 

```go
func(n *uast.Node) bool
```

Where uast.Node are the nodes that will be iterated during the annotation
process. You could define your own predicate functions but the `ann.go` file
has already defined the ones that you'll probably need most of the time:

- `Any()`: Always returns true. It's usually used to match the first node in 
  the native AST and add rules from there.

- `Not/And/Or(predicate)`: Applies the expected boolean operations to 
  the predicate(s) used as argument.

- `HasInternalType(type string)`: Checks if the InternalType of the node matches
  the string provided. What key is the InternalType of a native AST node is 
  defined in the `parser.ObjectToNoder.InternalTypeKey` field.

- `HasToken(name string)`: Checks if the node has a token matching the given
  string. What key of the node is a Token is defined in the 
  `parser.ObjectToNoder.TokenKeys` map.

- `HasChild(predicate)`: Checks if any of the first level children of
  the current node matches the given predicate.

- `HasProperty(key, value string)`: Checks if the AST node has some specific key
  and the key as the given value.

- `HasInternalRole(key string)`: Checks if the node has an InternalRole matching
  the specified key; this is a shortcut to `HasProperty(uast.InternalRoleKey,
  value)`. InternalRoles are added to children of any object keys holding them.

#### Actions

- `Roles(roles... uast.Role)`: Adds the given UAST role to the currently
  selected node(s).

- `Error(err Error)`: Produces an error and stop processing the AST.

#### Selectors

- `Self(rules ...*Rule)`: Selects the current node.

- `Children(rules ...*Rule)`: Select the children of the current node. Please note
   that only the first level children are selected, second level ("grandchildren")
   and others below are not selected (use Descendants for those).

- `Descendants(rules ...*Rule)`: Selects all (recursive) descendants of the
  selected node.

- `DescendantsOrSelf(rules ...*Rule)`: Selects the current node and all
  (recursive) descendants.

### Examples:

Check the already implemented [Java
annotator](https://github.com/bblfsh/java-driver/blob/master/driver/normalizer/annotation.go)
or the [Python
annotator](https://github.com/bblfsh/python-driver/blob/master/driver/normalizer/annotation.go)
for real world examples of this API in action.

### When in doubt...

[//]: # different languages have mapped their internal roles to the UAST ones.

You can also ask any doubt on the project's public [Babelfish Slack
channel](https://sourced-community.slack.com/join/shared_invite/MTkwNTM0ODEyODIzLTE0OTYxMzc5NTMtODRhMDYyNzAyYQ)
which is very friendly to newcomers to the project.

Finally, if you really think that there isn't a correspondence in the UAST roles
for the native role that you want to map, you can open an issue on the SDK project
or fork the [Babelfish SDK project
on Github](https://github.com/bblfsh/sdk), add the new role to the file
`uast/uast.go` and make a PR. Don't expect the role to be added inmediatedly;
we're somewhat picky about freely adding roles to the UAST and depending on the
stage of the project we strive for adding the more generalizable roles first
before adding exotic or very language-specific ones. If your role falls into the
second category the PR will be tagged as "need-research" which means that it will
be re-evaluated when a similar role is needed for other languages (and thus me can
see how to generalize it to cover more ground) or there is a new version of the
UAST.
