If you need support, want to contribute or just want to say hi, join us at the
[source{d} community Slack](https://join.slack.com/sourced-community/shared_invite/MTkwNTM0ODEyODIzLTE0OTYxMzc5NTMtODRhMDYyNzAyYQ).
We hang out in the `#babelfish` channel.

## Contributing

You can start contributing in many ways

* [Reporting bugs.](#reporting-bugs)
* [Request a feature.](#feature-requests)
* Improve the [documentation](http://github.com/bblfsh/documentation).
* Contribute code to the [bblfshd](http://github.com/bblfsh/bblfshd),
  [SDK](http://github.com/bblfsh/sdk).
* Contribute to [libuast](http://github.com/bblfsh/libuast),
  any of the [Python](http://github.com/bblfsh/client-python),
  [Go](http://github.com/bblfsh/client-go) or [Scala](http://github.com/bblfsh/client-scala)
  clients, or create a new client for your preferred language.
* Write a driver for a new language! If you plan to do this, we recommend you
  to talk to us first so we can coordinate efforts and assist you.

## Reporting bugs

Bugs should be reported through GitHub Issues. When you find a bug, report it
to the repository of the relevant component at the [bblfsh organization](https://github.com/bblfsh/).
If in doubt, report the bug to the [sdk repo](https://github.com/bblfsh/sdk)
with as much information as you have
(including the languages of the code you're parsing),
we can move it to whatever repo is more appropriate after reviewing it.

## Feature requests

If you want to request a new feature, feel free to open it as an issue at the
relevant GitHub repository.

For design changes we use the [Babelfish Improvement Proposals](proposals/README.md).
If the feature you want to request is quite complex
and could benefit from some deeper discussion,
consider initiating a BIP procedure,
as described in [BIP1](proposals/bip-001.md).
