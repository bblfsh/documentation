## Abstract

This BIP proposed a new official (as in defined in the Node struct and
documented) "AnnotationStatus" property that would mark if the role has been
annotated in any way and the quality of the current annotation.

## Rationale

At the current stage of the Babelfish project, we strive for genericity in the list
of UAST roles and not adding very language-specific features into it until we can
have a wider view about how to integrate or compose these roles for covering as
much ground as possible. 

This is a worthy objective but has the problem of leaving the nodes related with
these features unannotated or with annotations that don't fully express all
the semantic information that the language source code or the native AST have.

This BIP proposes to add a new property in the Nodes called "AnnotationStatus"
with the possible values of "Annotated", "Unannotated" and "Incomplete". This will
make the UAST user have a wider view of the completeness of the information
provided by it on specific nodes and also could help debug drivers and provide a
completeness summary, with the added benefit of providing a numerically
constatable measure of the completeness of every developed driver.

The Unannotated value for that property could be arguably less needed because it
can be inferred by the lack of any role in a specific node, but is proposed for
completeness. The "Incomplete" value, on the other hand, used in an additive way
with other roles in the UAST, would provide worthy information about the lack of
semantic information of the roles provided, which could be used by an UAST user to
treat those nodes in a different way or, when knowing the specific language, look
at the native AST information that the UAST nodes carry as properties.

Example:

If a version of the UAST specification didn't have a role that could be matched
for a "coroutine" type function supported by some language, the UAST could still
mark those nodes as "FunctionDef", but without additional information, this would be
providing incomplete and even misleading information to UAST users that could
treat coroutines differently (for example when making stack call deep analysis).

The Unannotated and Annotated marks would be added or removed automatically 
by the SDK so the driver developer would only have to take care of adding the 
Incomplete mark. The implementation would be pretty trivial on the SDK but it
could be a little more involved for the integration tests annotation coverage
report.

## Specification

This would modify the current specification by adding a new `AnnotationStatus`
property into the `Node` struct (and the UAST nodes) and a `const` enum with
the possible values.

## Alternatives

Instead of a new property, "Unannotated" and "Incomplete" could be UAST "meta"
roles. This would make this information available for potentials users that only
check the UAST roles, but would increase the size of the UAST and open the door
for more "meta" roles, so this author advises against it.

Another proposed alternative would be to drop the "Unannotated" and "Annotated"
statuses, since they can be inferred by the presence/ausence of roles in the Roles
field, and only use an "Incomplete" mark, either by using a boolean property in
the struct or a new UAST meta-role. This would have the advantage of simplifying
the implementation and reducing but would make the status less "greppable" and
less visually obvious when manually checking a generated UAST but that could also
be done with an sdk tool that could then be called at the end of the integration 
tests.

## Impact

- The `role.go` file would be modified for adding the new property in the `Role`
  struct and a `const` enum of the possible values.

- This new property would be documented in the `specification.md` file.

-  The "Incomplete" property would have to be added by driver developers when
   defining the rules in the annotation.go file. For this, we would implement a
   new action defined in `sdk/uast/ann.go` that could be called `SetIncomplete()`
   (Alternatively, we could provide a more generic `SetProperty(key, value)` but
   that could cause proliferation of undocumented properties by the driver
   programers.)

- This `SetIncomplete` function would have to be documented in the
  `annotations.md` file.

- The currently developer drivers would have to be updated to call the
  `SetIncomplete()` on the appropriate nodes.

- The integration-test implementation would have to be modified to provide the
  summary of annotation completeness at the end of the run. This basis for this
  report would be implemented as an SDK tool that then would be called at the
  end of the integration tests.
