# Join the Community

## Chat

If you need support, want to contribute or just want to say hi, join us at the [source{d} community Slack](https://join.slack.com/sourced-community/shared_invite/MTkwNTM0ODEyODIzLTE0OTYxMzc5NTMtODRhMDYyNzAyYQ). We hang out in the `#babelfish` channel.

## Contributing

You can start contributing in many ways

* [Reporting bugs.](join-the-community.md#reporting-bugs)
* [Request a feature.](join-the-community.md#feature-requests)
* Improve the [documentation](http://github.com/bblfsh/documentation).
* Contribute code to the [bblfshd](http://github.com/bblfsh/bblfshd), [SDK](http://github.com/bblfsh/sdk).
* Contribute to [libuast](http://github.com/bblfsh/libuast), any of the [Python](http://github.com/bblfsh/client-python), [Go](http://github.com/bblfsh/client-go) or [Scala](http://github.com/bblfsh/client-scala) clients, or create a new client for your preferred language.
* Write a driver for a new language! If you plan to do this, we recommend you to talk to us first so we can coordinate efforts and assist you.

## Reporting bugs

Bugs should be reported through GitHub Issues. When you find a bug, report it to the repository of the relevant component at the [bblfsh organization](https://github.com/bblfsh/). If in doubt, report the bug to the [sdk repo](https://github.com/bblfsh/sdk) with as much information as you have \(including the languages of the code you're parsing\), we can move it to whatever repo is more appropriate after reviewing it.

## Feature requests

If you want to request a new feature, feel free to open it as an issue at the relevant GitHub repository.

For design changes we use the [Babelfish Improvement Proposals](bip-index/babelfish-improvement-proposals.md). If the feature you want to request is quite complex and could benefit from some deeper discussion, consider initiating a BIP procedure, as described in [BIP1](bip-index/bip1-purpose-and-guidelines.md).
